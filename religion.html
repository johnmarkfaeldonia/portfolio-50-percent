            <p>Being a quat is difficult but it becomes easy if the Lord God is with us in our work, I became a quat as a child because I really want to be a police officer and I also want to serve the Church to be a part of it too, It's just a good feeling that the brothers and sisters feel safe when they see MCGI Security

            <a href="religion.html"><img src="./images/life/religion/03_religion_mcgi.jpg" height="200px"></a>
            <p>Being a part of MCGI Cares is a good feeling because you can serve GOD and share with people a gift, thank GOD for opportunities like this, it makes the heart grow when you know you are helping others.</p>

            <p>Being an MCGI production is one of my duties now because Technology has been my passion since I was young, I like to tinker with things and explore the cellphones of things I don't know yet, so maybe I ended up being IT</p>
